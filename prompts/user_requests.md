1) The “+ Add Specification Field” to the top of the “Edit Category Specifications” field. Maybe add fields from the top? A lot less down scrolling will be needed.

2) The listing of items on the main page is not important. The only way to find your item should be the search function. There will be 100’s of items in the future and this will reduce loading times. Same at the search section, please only list after searching.

3) Only the edit button on the main page listing works. Clicking the item first, then using the yellow button for editing, will bring you back to the main page.

4) The category is the most important and is mandatory. It should be asked first in the Add New Item field.

5) The “Item Details” window has the Name field in the blue bar, The “Basic Information” should only be “Category”. All other info should be under “Specifications”.

6) Search function not working yet?

7) Deleting an item from the collection should be asking for admin pass.

8) Possibility for user login to enter main site?
